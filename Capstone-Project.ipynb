Business Problem\n\nIn this project, we will find an optimal location for opening up a Taiwanses signature beef noodle restaurant in Taipei. Taipei is a small city with a dense population that has an unique culture for food. This specific dish, Taiwanese beef noodles, is widely popular by both local residents and foreign tourists, hence the high competitiveness amongst restaurants. In order to locate a situable spot, we will be looking for two criterias. First,  there should be as little beef noodle selling restaurants as possible near by. Second, it should be near a tourist spot or centers to raise the accessibility of the store. "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"1b. Interest\n\nThis solution is obviously advantagous for anyone that plans to open up a beef noddle restuarant in Taipei. However, this model can also be refered as a template for different types of shop owners to utilize in choosing an optimal location in Taipei. "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 2.
